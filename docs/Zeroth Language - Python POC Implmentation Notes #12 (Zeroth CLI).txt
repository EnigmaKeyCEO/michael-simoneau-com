Excellent. You’re asking for a language-native command surface, not a generic CLI.
What follows is a coherent, minimal, powerful zeroth command taxonomy that maps directly to Zeroth’s primitives: state, alignment, convergence, observation, history, potential.
This is not feature creep.
This is operational ontology.
________________


Zeroth CLI — Conceptual Command Surface
The rule we’ll follow:
Every command must correspond to something that already exists in the running system.
No synthetic abstractions. No dev-only hacks.
________________


Top-Level Command
zeroth <command> [target] [options]


If no command is provided:
zeroth program.zero|program.z


→ run (already implemented)
________________


Core Command Groups (By Primitive)
________________


1. run — Existence / Execution
Primitive: iteration, potential, time
zeroth run hello.zero
zeroth run hello.z


Alias for the default behavior.
Purpose:
* explicit invocation
* scripting clarity
* future flags (ports, limits)
________________


2. observe — Measurement / Collapse Interface
Primitive: observation, truth visibility
Observe current projection
zeroth observe


Output (CLI, not HTML):
Iteration: 18234
Convergence: 0.0412
Dominant: HELLO_UNIVERSE


Observe specific state / dimension
zeroth observe state HELLO
zeroth observe dimension 7


Observe without recording history (rare, but valid)
zeroth observe --passive


Use case:
* debugging
* sanity checks
* “peek without touching”
________________


3. history — Time / Lineage / Proof
Primitive: history = time
View recent history
zeroth history


Filter by type
zeroth history observations
zeroth history collapses
zeroth history merges


Explain a projection (critical)
zeroth history explain


Output:
HELLO_UNIVERSE emerged because:
- Dimension 3 decayed (WORLD)
- Dimension 7 merged with 12
- Observation pressure stabilized UNIVERSE


This is your “how it got there” command.
________________


4. state — Ontological Units
Primitive: state
List states
zeroth state list


Inspect a state
zeroth state HELLO


Output:
Influence: 0.3821
Dimensions: [3, 7, 12]
Potential: active


Inject potential manually (engineer-only)
zeroth state HELLO --inject -1


This is legal in Zeroth: engineered disturbance.
________________


5. align — Structural Forces
Primitive: alignment
Show alignments
zeroth align list


Inspect alignment
zeroth align HELLO UNIVERSE


Live-adjust alignment (advanced)
zeroth align HELLO UNIVERSE --strength 0.5


This:
* alters topology
* preserves memory
* lets the system adapt
________________


6. converge — Truth / Stability
Primitive: convergence
Check convergence
zeroth converge


Force evaluation (no mutation)
zeroth converge --check


Force collapse if within tolerance
zeroth converge --commit


This explicitly triggers:
* truth recording
* potential reinjection
Useful for experiments.
________________


7. potential — Negative Space Control
Primitive: -1, directed possibility
View active potential
zeroth potential


Inject system-wide potential
zeroth potential inject -1


Inject localized potential
zeroth potential inject state HELLO -1


This is controlled chaos, by design.
________________


8. dimension — Field Geometry
Primitive: tokenizer / field dynamics
List dimensions
zeroth dimension list


Inspect dimension
zeroth dimension 7


Output:
Orientation: -1
Tokens: [HELLO, UNIVERSE]
Lineage: [3, 12]


Merge / decay (engineer-only)
zeroth dimension merge 7 12
zeroth dimension decay 5


Normally automatic — but exposed for experimentation.
________________


9. compile — Intent → Artifact
Primitive: representation
zeroth compile hello.zero


Outputs:
hello.z


Optional flags:
--optimize
--freeze
--emit-lineage


________________


10. status — System Introspection
Primitive: awareness
zeroth status


Output:
PID: 48321
Program: hello.zero
Iteration: 92833
Convergence: 0.062
States: 3
Dimensions: 14
Observations: 217


This is your heartbeat.
________________


11. stop / kill — End of Existence
Primitive: termination (external only)
zeroth stop


Graceful:
* stop loop
* flush history
* exit cleanly
________________


Command Philosophy (Why This Works)
* Every command maps to a real concept
* Nothing is “debug-only”
* Nothing lies about system state
* The CLI is a measurement device, not a controller
* You can shape reality, not script it
This makes Zeroth feel:
* alive
* inspectable
* honest
* deterministic
* profound without being mystical
________________


Implementation Note (Practical)
All of these commands can be implemented as:
* a local control socket (Unix domain socket)
* JSON command messages
* handled by the running daemon
No REST.
No HTTP abuse.
No cloud.

Next Logical Step (When You’re Ready)
The next engineering artifact would be:
zeroth control socket protocol
→ how CLI commands talk to the live process safely.
But first: this command surface needs your approval.
________________


Single, literal question:
Do you want zeroth commands to talk over a Unix socket or a TCP localhost port?
