  performance_system:
    structure:
      hash:
        role: "Public Key"
        properties:
          - Contains positional categorical markers
          - Acts as lookup key for performance data
          - Encodes high-level performance indicators
          - Maintains parent reference information
        example_positions:
          - "0-3: Parent identifiers (hex)"
          - "4-5: Performance category markers"
          - "6-7: Market condition indicators"
          - "8-11: Behavioral characteristics"
      
      ledger:
        role: "Value Store"
        access: "Hash-based lookup"
        contents:
          - Detailed performance metrics
          - Complete execution history
          - Market condition details
          - Evolution records
        privacy: "Only accessible through valid DNA hashes"

    key_value_relationship:
      key:
        - Public DNA hash with positional meaning
        - Contains categorical markers
        - Self-verifying through checksum
        - Immutable once created
      value:
        - Private detailed performance data
        - Accessible only through valid hash
        - Immutable once recorded
        - Linked to specific DNA instance

implications:
  implementation:
    CodeDNA:
      - Must generate position-aware hashes
      - Must maintain hash-to-performance mapping
      - Must verify parent relationships
      - Must ensure hash immutability
    
    PerformanceLedger:
      - Must use DNA hash as primary key
      - Must maintain data immutability
      - Must verify hash validity before storage
      - Must handle hash-based lookups efficiently

  system_design:
    - Hash structure becomes critical for system operation
    - Performance data access controlled through DNA hashes
    - Evolution tracked through hash relationships
    - System scalability tied to hash design

revised_next_steps:
  priority_1:
    - "Design hash structure with precise position mapping"
    - "Implement hash generation with categorical encoding"
    - "Create hash-based performance ledger system"
  
  priority_2:
    - "Implement parent verification through hash structure"
    - "Create evolution tracking through hash relationships"
    - "Develop hash-based access control for performance data"

notes:
  - Hash design must balance information density with usability
  - Performance data privacy maintained through hash-based access
  - System more closely aligned with blockchain principles
  - Hash position mapping crucial for system operation
  - Evolution tracking simplified through hash relationships
