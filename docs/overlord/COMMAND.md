You are designing an **interactive Three.js website** using **React + Vite** that visually and conceptually expresses a *living cryptographic system* called **Zeroth / Protocol0**.

This is NOT a typical blockchain website.
This is a **living system visualization**.

---

## CORE CONCEPT (DO NOT SIMPLIFY)

The system represents a **living computation and cryptographic economy** based on:

* **Observation creates reality**
* **Truth converges to zero**
* **Potential (-1) constantly re-enters the system**
* **Everything has halflife**
* **Value decays unless reinforced**
* **Blocks, hashes, and tokens are alive**
* **Deletion is convergence, not loss**
* **No miners, no fees — usage is mining**
* **Only integers exist (no decimals)**

This is a *Zeroth Theory* system:

* `-1, 0, +1` are **ontological states**, not numbers
* Time = iteration count
* History = observation log
* Identity = cryptographic lineage, not wallets or users

---

## VISUAL METAPHOR (MANDATORY)

Use **Three.js** to render:

### 1. A Living Field

* A 3D field / space (dark, minimal, elegant)
* Nodes = **hashes**
* Clusters = **blocks**
* Connections = **lineage**
* The system is always *in motion*, even when idle

### 2. Hashes

Each hash:

* Is a glowing point or small polyhedron
* Has:

  * **Position** (orientation / signed ternary)
  * **Intensity** (current weight)
  * **Halflife decay** (fades unless reinforced)
* Gradually fades toward black / zero unless reinforced
* When fully converged → disappears smoothly (not abruptly)

### 3. Blocks

* Blocks are **clusters of hashes**
* Block size / glow depends on aggregate weight
* When all hashes in a block converge:

  * The entire block dissolves
  * No explosion, no drama — *completion*

### 4. Reinforcement

* When a “transaction” or “observation” occurs:

  * Energy flows into a hash
  * Nearby lineage lights up
  * New hashes may spawn
* Reinforcement must feel **earned**, not spammy

### 5. Halflife

* Time-based decay is always visible
* Subtle pulsing or dimming tied to iteration count
* This is critical: **decay is constant and honest**

## INTERACTION MODEL

### Observation

* Merely viewing the page does NOT mutate state
* Explicit interactions do:

  * Click
  * Drag
  * Trigger “transact” button
* Each interaction:

  * Generates a new “observation”
  * Causes a visible reaction
  * Advances iteration

### Controls (Minimal, Elegant)

* “Observe”
* “Transact”
* “Reinforce”
* “Let Decay”

Each should map to a **clear visual outcome**.

---

## ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

### Tech Stack

* React
* Vite
* Three.js (via `@react-three/fiber` preferred)
* Minimal CSS (dark mode by default)
* No UI frameworks unless absolutely necessary

### State Model

* Maintain a simulation loop (iteration counter)
* Hash objects should include:

  * id (string)
  * weight (integer)
  * halflife
  * lastReinforcedIteration
  * lineage / parent ids
* Blocks aggregate hashes
* All math should be deterministic

### Performance

* Must run smoothly on a laptop
* No heavy shaders
* Prefer instancing where possible

---

## TONE & AESTHETIC

* Serious
* Minimal
* Scientific
* Slightly mysterious
* No hype language
* No crypto buzzwords
* No marketing fluff

This should feel like:

* a physics experiment
* a living theorem
* an observatory
* not a product page

---

## OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

Deliver:

1. A complete React + Vite project
2. A main scene component that renders the living system
3. Clean separation between:

   * simulation logic
   * rendering logic
4. Clear comments explaining *why* things exist
5. Reasonable defaults (not hard-coded nonsense)

---

## IMPORTANT

Do NOT:

* Reduce this to “nodes and edges”
* Turn it into a price chart
* Add fake blockchain visuals
* Over-explain with text

Let the **system speak visually**.

If something must be explained, do it through **motion and decay**.

This is an expression of a **living cryptographic lineage system**, not a demo.

Treat it with respect.

The previously undocumented Lineage Limitation Price Minimum Constraint is now documented below:
On the THTH website, you will be able to swap USDC natively for WTHTH, which is a wrapped version of the THTH token blocks as explained before and should be fully operational via the wallet provider you choose and `contracts/WTHTH.sol`. This is not just a convenience, it is a fundamental part of the system that prevents value from exploding or collapsing illegitimately. SINCE THE SYSTEM IS INTEGER BASED, no decimals are allowed, THAT MEANS 1 WTHTH is worth MINIMUM 1 USDC. Which makes it THE FIRST CRYPTOCURRENCY TO HAVE REAL INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON ITS OWN MECHANICS AND NOT ON MARKET PRICES OR SOCIAL CONSENSUS WHILE ALSO ALLOWING FOR NATIVE TRANSACTIONS; AND, WILL NEVER BE WORTH LESS THAN 1 USDC!

## 10% Profit Share Sweep

The crypto-fabric platform is a platform for DePINs and Validators that runs ZerothVM as a systemd service. Profits from Zeroth rewards are integrated to distribute tokens to users of the crypto-fabric platform, primarily to hand out tokens to platform users.

The **10% profit share sweep** mechanism collects a portion of Zeroth rewards and distributes them through the crypto-fabric platform. The **origin wallet** for this profit share sweep is:

**`0x888388bfcef6ff298f5ee84cd45e908bf1043148`**

This wallet receives the 10% profit share from Zeroth rewards, which are then integrated into the crypto-fabric platform's token distribution system for platform users.
