status:
  goal: "DNA Hash Coefficient System Definition"
  completion: 0.35
  last_update: "2023-12-22T15:15:00Z"

critical_insight:
  hash_values:
    principle: "Hash positions contain actual operational coefficients"
    implementation:
      - Hex values translate directly to decimal coefficients
      - Each position or group represents a specific weight/coefficient
      - Values are used directly in engine calculations
      - Position determines which aspect the coefficient affects

    engine_specific_usage:
      engine1:
        purpose: "Technical Indicator Weights"
        example_coefficients:
          - RSI sensitivity
          - Moving average periods
          - Volatility thresholds
          - Volume significance
        application: "Direct use in indicator calculations"

      engine2:
        purpose: "Decision Factor Weights"
        example_coefficients:
          - Trend strength importance
          - Risk tolerance levels
          - Time horizon weights
          - Confidence thresholds
        application: "Direct use in decision algorithms"

      engine3:
        purpose: "Validation Criteria Weights"
        example_coefficients:
          - Performance metric weights
          - Risk assessment factors
          - Stability measures
          - Consistency requirements
        application: "Direct use in validation calculations"

    coefficient_properties:
      format: "Hexadecimal (0-F)"
      conversion: "Hex to decimal for actual use"
      range: "0-255 (two hex digits) or 0-65535 (four hex digits)"
      precision: "Determined by position allocation size"

    evolution_implications:
      - Mutations modify actual coefficient values
      - Performance directly tied to coefficient changes
      - Parent DNA contributes working coefficient values
      - Evolution optimizes coefficients through performance

implementation_requirements:
  CodeDNA:
    coefficient_handling:
      - Must convert hex positions to usable decimals
      - Must maintain coefficient precision
      - Must track coefficient effectiveness
      - Must support coefficient mutation
    
    position_mapping:
      - Must clearly define which positions affect which coefficients
      - Must maintain consistent position meanings
      - Must support engine-specific coefficient ranges
      - Must allow for coefficient value extraction

  performance_tracking:
    coefficient_analysis:
      - Track effectiveness of specific coefficient values
      - Monitor coefficient value ranges
      - Identify optimal coefficient combinations
      - Guide coefficient evolution

revised_next_steps:
  priority_1:
    - "Define complete coefficient position mapping"
    - "Implement hex-to-decimal coefficient conversion"
    - "Create coefficient extraction methods"
    - "Implement coefficient-aware mutation system"
  
  priority_2:
    - "Develop coefficient optimization tracking"
    - "Create coefficient combination rules"
    - "Implement coefficient-based evolution guidance"

notes:
  - Coefficient positions must be carefully mapped to maintain meaning
  - Conversion precision is crucial for consistent behavior
  - Evolution must respect coefficient value ranges
  - Performance tracking must link to specific coefficient values
  - System becomes self-optimizing through coefficient evolution
