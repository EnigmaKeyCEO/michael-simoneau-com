## Interview Session 1: The Quantum Revolution

*Interviewer: What was your first job in technology?*

If you want to know more about that, I'll send you a link to the full interview (and add the link in the comments). How about we focus on my vision for the future, and what makes me credible... Let's pick up somehwere far after that other initial interview took place.... that's only where it started.

*Interviewer: What's the most critical security threat facing modern AI systems?*

The most critical threat is quantum computing's potential to break existing cryptographic protocols. As quantum computers advance toward practical computational advantage, our current cryptographic infrastructure faces obsolescence. This isn't speculation - it's an impending reality that demands immediate attention.

*Interviewer: How does this specifically impact AI systems?*

AI systems are particularly vulnerable due to their sensitive training data, proprietary algorithms, and potential for amplifying security breaches. We need to address multiple layers: data transport, model protection, inference integrity, and the entire training pipeline. At StoneX, I implemented a hybrid cryptographic approach that maintained backward compatibility while introducing quantum resistance.

*Interviewer: What's your recommended strategy for CTOs facing this transition?*

The transition doesn't require waiting for NIST to finalize all standards. A pragmatic approach includes crypto agility, hybrid implementations, risk-based prioritization, and continuous monitoring. The organizations that begin their quantum-resistant transition today will gain not just security, but substantial competitive advantage.

## Interview Session 2: Legacy System Termination

*Interviewer: Tell me about your most challenging legacy system transformation.*

I terminated a $2M legacy nightmare in 90 days. It was a 15-year-old trading platform causing $2M in monthly losses due to downtime, maintenance costs, and missed market opportunities. The system had 94.5% uptime, 8-hour deployment windows requiring weekend overtime, $350,000 monthly maintenance costs, and zero documentation for critical components.

*Interviewer: What was your approach to this transformation?*

My approach was systematic and methodical. First, I documented every component and its dependencies. Then, I implemented a parallel system with modern architecture, gradually migrating functionality while maintaining business continuity. The result was 99.99% uptime and a 77% reduction in monthly costs.

## Interview Session 3: Technical Leadership

*Interviewer: How did you scale React Native to support 50+ white label clients?*

The key was in the architecture. We designed a modular system that could support multiple client configurations while maintaining sub-200ms load times. This required careful consideration of shared components, client-specific customizations, and performance optimization at every layer.

*Interviewer: What's the most common security gap you see in modern AI deployments?*

Most AI implementations have a critical security vulnerability that few CTOs recognize. The issue lies in the assumption that traditional security measures are sufficient for AI systems. They're not. AI systems require specialized security protocols that account for their unique attack vectors and data sensitivity.

*Interviewer: How do you approach negotiating high-value CTO packages?*

The difference between a $300K and $500K+ compensation package often comes down to strategic positioning. You need to demonstrate your value as a revenue-generating asset rather than a cost center. This involves quantifying your impact on business outcomes and articulating your vision for technological transformation.

*Interviewer: What specific metrics do you use to quantify the success of a technical transformation?*

I use REAL WORLD metrics. The easiest way to explain this, usually comes down to money. does it cost more, or less? Does it scale, or not? Does it sell or not? The point is to shift your metric and validate your assumptions. Take pause, and reflect on where you're spending your time. you will naturally find where you spend your money! The metric changes, and THAT's the thing most people do not understand. it's not velocity, it's ACCELLERATION!

*Interviewer: How do you identify which metrics matter most to a business?*

In the same way that I assess everything. I do something similar to reconnaissance. I assess  their business model, and how it aligns with their mission. I disect the method of how they're currently achieving that. I remove non-essential components to focus on spending time and resources on the tasks that actually achieve results. I am emphatic about performance, review, and optimization... but most of all, innovation!

*Interviewer: What's the most innovative solution you've implemented in your career?*

The most innovative solution I've implemented in my career is yet to come. The solution is called the yachtoffice and it is in automatic autonomous, unmonitored, self-learning, real-time self-rewriting, performance optimization and decision-making model that uses a series of NSA Agents to construct real-time models, retrained dynamically based on user input!

But aside from the shameless plug, in the spirit of your question the most innovative solution that I've implemented in my career was that I made a drunk dial service that was like text from last night or that one website that was cool for a while, but it was voicemails from last night and it was a phone number you could call and I used Grand Central before Google voice bought it and turned it into Google voice and it did not have an API so I had to sniff requests using their interface so that I could understand the request signatures and responses and I built a public mobile drunk dial line. This was in 2004 I think.

*Interviewer: How do you stay ahead of emerging technologies?*

By inventing them! I read and learn from around me I take tons of input and I'm open to all sorts of angles of vision, but I'm certain confident in my understanding and perspective of reality.

*Interviewer: What's your vision for the future of technology?*

Well, that's simple. It's obviously quantum computing, but the funny thing is is that there's no bridge between the quantum theory and classical physics which governs our current computing system so even if we do invent quantum computing, we don't have a method of taking full advantage of it. Well, lo and behold, I invented that theory and I have made a proof of concept and it's logically sound, and I can prove it, but I need more money. I need funding and research to scale it using these new quantum chips that Microsoft has designed.

*Interviewer: What's the biggest challenge you face in advancing your quantum computing theory?*

Easy. Learning to use Knowledge over rules, Never trust what you are TOLD, ONLY TRUST WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE YOURSELF. Challenge EVERYTHING you have been told... but, most of all, You Cannot Know Anything, Until You Know Yourself! Fear causes Anxiety, Knowledge is Power! Acceptance and Control! ACCEPT the things you CAN NOT control and TAKE control of the things you CAN

*Interviewer: What advice would you give to aspiring technologists?*

"Learn HOW to think, instead of WHAT to think"

*Interviewer: What's your next big project?*

Proving that I'm right! Not by arguing, but by living the things i speak. By diligently, through self-dicipline, working towards my goals. Currently. I have decided to "Walk the Walk"... I am homeless again. I'm writing this now from a McDonalds Free Wifi... I can prove it by: "Starting Over and Trying Again! From the Beginning! BUT WTH ALL I KNOW NOW!" This sounds like a dream, but just change your life! I just posted a challenge to a company, (publicly, on linkedin, where I have 1200 followers) that I have a plan to make $10,000.00 in 2 weeks, and here's how: And publicized my challenge. then privatized the conversation by adding to the message, and sending the link to the hiring manager. Withrowing from the job. Offering my BETTER option instead. Their choice. I can only help those who want to be helped. I do not need 'you', I need anyone who is willing to be successful, and knows that they need to look forwards to do that. it's about HOW you do what you do... spend less time on less important things.. How will you do that if you do not understand what is actually important to accruing revenue and reducing expenses?

*Interviewer: What's your message to those who doubt your approach?*

"Do you want to make $10K in 2 weeks?", no, then I don't have time to explain it to 'you' anyhow. "NEXT!"
