## Service Layer Architecture

The application implements a robust service layer pattern with the following core services:

### AIService
- Handles all GenKit AI operations
- Manages image generation and optimization
- Implements quantum-resistant error handling

### StorageService
- Manages file operations
- Handles image uploads and deletions
- Implements strict file validation

### AuthService
- Manages user authentication
- Handles user session management
- Implements secure password operations

### ConfigService
- Manages application configuration
- Handles environment variables
- Implements validation rules

## Error Handling

The application implements a robust error handling system with:
- Custom error classes for each service
- Centralized error handling
- Detailed error logging
- Type-safe error propagation

## Type Safety

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Comprehensive interface definitions
- Runtime type checking
- Immutable data structures

## Security

- Quantum-resistant authentication
- Secure file handling
- Environment variable protection
- Input validation

## Performance

- Optimized rendering
- Efficient state management
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting

## Development Guidelines

1. All new components must be functional components
2. Use TypeScript for all new code
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add comprehensive documentation
